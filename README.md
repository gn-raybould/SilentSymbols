# SilentSymbols

Silent Symbols is designed to help aspiring ASL learners practice their finger-spelling skills. This interactive application offers two distinct modes to cater to different skill levels: **Easy**, which presents one letter at a time for users to identify, and **Hard**, which challenges users with randomly generated four-letter words. Upon launching the application, users can select their preferred mode before engaging with the finger-spelling exercises. If at any point they require a new challenge or wish to switch modes, they have the flexibility to return to the home screen.

The design of Silent Symbols is not only focused on functionality but also on enhancing the learning experience through gamification. The easy mode allows beginners to gradually build their confidence in finger-spelling, while the hard mode encourages quicker thinking and recall. With a structured approach, users are prompted with questions that test their understanding and recognition of ASL letters and words, creating a comprehensive learning tool that adapts to the learner's journey in mastering American Sign Language.
